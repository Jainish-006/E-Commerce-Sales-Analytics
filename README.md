# E-Commerce-Sales-Analytics

The project idea revolves around the concept of sales product analytics and effective usage of tremendous amounts of sales data generated on a daily basis. Sales analytics is a popular method used by most modern organizations to gain an advantage over their competitors and at the same time keep track of their own goals. The project aims to incorporate data visualization as a tool to effectively represent the data and gain maximum insight regarding the transnational data set which contains all the transactions that occurred in 2019 for registered non-store online retail in the USA. The visualizations have been designed in such a way that the data can be easily interpreted. The first visualization talks about the general sales trend observed throughout the year 2019. The second visualization consists of a dashboard with interactive features in it like the radio buttons and sliders to toggle between various states and months in 2019. This dashboard provides the necessary information regarding the regions that are the most active with respect to the sales and also highlights the best-selling products with respect to each region. Lastly, we have used heatmap to gain insights about the rush hour, so that we could comment on which time period during the day is the most active with respect to customers buying the products. We also implemented a bar graph in direct correlation to this to break down the 24 hours format into an easy to interpret format.
